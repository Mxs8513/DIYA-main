# D.I.Y.A — Digital Intake Yielding Answers

> An AI-powered academic workflow automation platform that routes student questions through an intelligent pipeline, surfaces confusion patterns, and enables professor-in-the-loop review — all backed by RAG-grounded answers from real course materials.

---

## What Is This?

D.I.Y.A started as a class forum tool and evolved into a full operational intelligence platform for academic environments. The core idea: instead of professors manually answering hundreds of repetitive student questions, D.I.Y.A intercepts each question, runs it through an AI routing engine, generates a draft answer grounded in the professor's own course materials, scores its own confidence, and only escalates to the professor when it's uncertain.

The result is a system where professors spend time on the questions that actually need them — not the ones Claude can handle in 500ms.

## Feature Summary

### For Students
- **Forum** — post questions to your class group, see AI-generated answers verified by your professor
- **Office Hours** — request 1-on-1 time with subject and preferred schedule
- **Self-Check** — upload your rubric + your work, get an AI grade with specific improvement suggestions before you submit
- **Group Join** — join classes via invite code

### For Professors
- **Workflow Queue** — review every AI-generated answer before it goes live; approve, reject, or override
- **Confusion Clusters** — automatic detection when ≥3/6/10 students ask about the same topic (medium/high/critical severity)
- **Interventions** — create targeted announcements, review sessions, or office hours in response to clusters; track whether they worked
- **Answer Library** — approved answers get stored and auto-served to future duplicate questions
- **Knowledge Base** — upload PDFs, DOCX, or notes; answers are grounded in your actual course material via RAG
- **Analytics** — AI-generated topic breakdown, question trends, engagement insights
- **Observability** — real-time AI metrics: latency, token usage, escalation rate, duplicate reduction rate, error tracking

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18+ (tested on v20 in CI; works on v26)
- An Anthropic API key is **optional** — without one, the app runs in a
  deterministic demo mode (keyword topic classification, template answers,
  graceful "AI disabled" states). Add a key to enable real AI answers,
  confidence scoring, analysis, and self-check grading.

### Installation

```bash
# 1. Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# 2. Install backend dependencies
cd server && npm install && cd ..
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
cp server/.env.example server/.env
# then edit server/.env (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is optional for the demo)
```

### Seed the demo database (recommended)

```bash
npm run seed          # → creates server/diya.db with a full CHEM 1301 demo class
```

This populates a believable class: 1 professor, 4 students, 14 forum questions
(verified / pending / escalated), approved answers, confusion clusters, an
intervention with tracked effectiveness, office-hour requests, a self-check
report, AI metrics, and notifications. Safe to run on a fresh clone (the schema
lives in `server/db.js`, shared by the server and the seed script).

### Running

```bash
npm run dev:all       # backend + frontend together (recommended)

# …or run them separately:
npm run server        # Backend → http://localhost:3001
npm run dev           # Frontend → http://localhost:5173
```

### Demo Credentials

After `npm run seed`, log in with (all passwords are `demo1234`, **local demo only**):

| Role | Email | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Professor | `dr.chen@university.edu` | Owns CHEM 1301, sees the workflow queue, clusters, metrics |
| Student | `alex.r@uni.edu` | Member of CHEM 1301 |
| Student | `priya.p@uni.edu` | Member of CHEM 1301 |
| — | Group invite code | `CHEM01` |

### Try it from scratch (the real flow)

1. Sign up as a **professor** → create a class group (you get an invite code).
2. Sign up as a **student** → join with the code.
3. Post a forum question as the student.
4. Watch the AI routing engine process it: open the **Workflow Queue** as the professor.
5. Approve an AI answer → it appears verified to the student and lands in the **Answer Library**.

### Available scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `npm run dev` | Vite dev server (frontend) |
| `npm run server` | Express API |
| `npm run dev:all` | both, together (Ctrl-C stops both) |
| `npm run seed` | (re)build the demo database |
| `npm run build` | production frontend build |
| `npm run preview` | preview the production build |
| `npm run check` | TypeScript type-check (`tsc --noEmit`) |
| `npm test` | backend test suite (delegates to `server`) |

## Testing & CI

Automated tests run in GitHub Actions on every push/PR (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`):
the backend suite (`cd server && npm test`) plus a frontend type-check and build.

- **30 backend tests** (`node:test`) covering auth, group create/join, forum posting,
  workflow record creation, professor approval/rejection, knowledge-doc listing,
  admin health/metrics, and **RBAC** (non-members and non-owners get `403`), plus
  unit tests for the AI-workflow fallbacks (topic classification, duplicate
  detection, intervention/announcement fallbacks, routing when AI is disabled) and
  RAG helpers (chunking, cosine similarity).
- See [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) for the full coverage map.

```bash
npm test          # backend unit + integration tests (isolated temp DB)
npm run check     # frontend type-check
```

## What This Project Demonstrates (for reviewers)

| Area | Where to look |
|---|---|
| **Full-stack architecture** | React/Vite SPA ↔ Express API ↔ SQLite, with a Vite dev proxy |
| **Role-based access control** | `requireAuth` / `requireRole` / `requireGroupAccess` in `server/server.js` — professors are scoped to groups they own, students to groups they joined |
| **AI workflow orchestration** | `server/services/ai-workflow.js`: classify → dedupe → RAG → draft → confidence-score → route/escalate → record |
| **RAG document retrieval** | `server/services/rag.js`: local embeddings (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`), chunking, cosine similarity, PDF/DOCX/TXT/MD ingestion |
| **Async, job-style processing** | questions are routed asynchronously after the POST returns; results land in the workflow queue |
| **Observability** | `ai_metrics` table + `/api/admin/metrics` (latency, tokens, error/escalation/duplicate rates) |
| **Human-in-the-loop review** | every AI answer is "pending professor review" until approved; approvals feed the reusable answer library |
| **SQLite schema design** | `server/db.js` — 13 tables, foreign keys, WAL mode, additive migrations |
| **API design** | consistent REST surface, typed client in `src/lib/api.ts` |
| **Testing / CI** | `server/test/*`, GitHub Actions, type-check + build gate |
| **Graceful degradation** | the app is fully usable with **no** API key (deterministic fallbacks + clear "AI disabled" UI) |

---

## Known Limitations / Future Work

Honest tradeoffs made to keep the project focused:

- **Demo-only pages.** A few professor/student screens render representative
  static data rather than live API calls: `EditGroupPage`, `CalendarPage`,
  `TopicDetailPage`, and `student/TopicAnalysisPage`. The data flow they depict is
  real; wiring them to endpoints is future work. (`RequestsPage` **was** mock and
  is now fully wired to the office-hours API.)
- **Duplicate detection uses lexical Jaccard similarity**, not embeddings —
  cheap and dependency-free, but it misses paraphrases. Embedding-based dedupe
  (the RAG model is already loaded) is the natural upgrade.
- **No rate limiting yet.** Documented intentionally (see Security below); the
  next step is `express-rate-limit` on auth + AI endpoints.
- **No frontend component tests** (only type-check + build). React Testing
  Library / Vitest is the planned addition.
- **RAG retrieval isn't unit-tested end-to-end** because it requires downloading
  the embedding model; only the pure helpers are tested.
- **AI answer quality depends on the configured model**; without an API key the
  app uses deterministic template fallbacks (clearly surfaced in the UI).

---

## Security Notes

- **Auth**: bcrypt (cost 12) password hashing; JWT (7-day). `JWT_SECRET` is
  required in production — the server refuses to boot on the dev fallback when
  `NODE_ENV=production`.
- **Authorization**: every group-scoped route enforces ownership/membership, so a
  logged-in user cannot read or mutate another class's data.
- **Error hygiene**: a central error handler returns generic messages — no stack
  traces or file paths leak to clients; unknown `/api/*` routes return JSON `404`.
- **Uploads**: 20 MB limit, type-checked (PDF/DOCX/TXT/MD), stored as text chunks
  (raw files are never persisted).
- **CORS** is env-configurable via `CORS_ORIGIN` (defaults to any localhost port
  for development).
- **Rate limiting** is intentionally **not** included yet — out of scope for a
  single-node demo. For production, add `express-rate-limit` to `/api/auth/*` and
  the AI endpoints.

---

## Deployment Notes

- **Backend**: any Node host (Render/Railway/Fly/VM). Set `NODE_ENV=production`,
  a strong `JWT_SECRET`, `CORS_ORIGIN=https://<your-frontend>`, and optionally
  `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. SQLite (`DB_PATH`) needs a persistent disk; for higher
  scale, migrate the schema in `server/db.js` to Postgres.
- **Frontend**: `npm run build` → deploy the static `dist/` to any static host
  (Vercel/Netlify/S3). Point the SPA's `/api` calls at the deployed backend
  (replace the dev proxy with the API origin, or serve both behind one domain).
